RaidMetrics
===========
RaidMetrics allows guilds or other raiding bodies in World of Warcraft to 
process and host their own raid log statistics.  The intended functionality
is similiar to WWS and World of Logs.

The project is released under the MIT/X11 license.  See the LICENSE file for
more details.

The project's home URL is: http://www.raidmetrics.org
The issues tracker is at: http://www.raidmetrics.org/project/raidmetrics/issues

IMPORTANT: Unless you know what you're doing, do not deploy off the master
branch of the repository.  Use tagged releases or download the release file
from the website.

Also, the log import functionality is still in flux.  If you deploy this
application before all work on importing log files is settled, you may need to
clear your production databse and reimport log files for future releases.

Requirements
------------
Currently no gems are bundled within the RaidMetrics distribution.  In order
to use RaidMetrics, you will need to have the rails gem installed.  You will
also need to have a gem installed for your desired database.

If you wish to run the tests and features, you will need to install the rspec,
rspec-rails, spork, webrat, and cucumber gems.

RaidMetrics has only been tested on MySQL but there is no reason why it
should not work with other databases.

Installing
----------
The only application configuration required is to set up the databse.  To do
this, copy config/database-example.yml to config/database.yml and edit
appropriately.

Importing log files
-------------------
Once the application is set up, you will need to import log files.  Do this
using the following command for each log file:

ruby script/runner bin/log_import.rb LOGFILE

Where you replace LOGFILE with the path of the log file.
